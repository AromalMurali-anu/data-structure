# data-structure
the data structure are a particular way of organising and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modify Efficiency is all about choosing the right tool for the job. The speed and memory usage of different structures can vary wildly depending on how you're using them 
ðŸ§  Why They Matter
- Help manage and process data efficiently
- Make it easier to search, update, and sort information
- Crucial for algorithms, applications, and real-world problem solving
A list is an ordered, mutable collection of items. You can store anything in a list â€” numbers, strings, other lists, or even a mix of types.
for an example
                -my_list = [10, 'hello', [1, 2], 3.14]
tuple is a orered,  intext, immutable collection that can hold any type of data
                            - When you want to protect data from accidental modification
                            - For performance â€” tuples are slightly faster and use less memory
                            - As dictionary keys (lists canâ€™t be used as theyâ€™re mutable)

                            ðŸ§  Cool Use Case: Tuple Unpacking
                                a, b, c = my_tuple
                                print(b)  # Output: 20
